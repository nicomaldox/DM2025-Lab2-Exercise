    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Trust:** LLMs can \"hallucinate\" or invent information. We need to ensure the extracted data is accurate and comes directly from the source text.\n",
    "2.  **Scalability:** We need a reliable way to extract complex information consistently from thousands of large, messy documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to these challenges is **grounding**—the process of linking every piece of extracted data back to its specific origin in the source document. This creates a verifiable audit trail, building trust in the output."

    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
