StarPlatinum55\nVery good. It's the best DB film imo.\n2. LeratoNull\nStill inferior to Battle of Gods, still very good tho.\n3. u4004\nBoth movies have mediocre stories, both have entertaining characters. DBS: Broly has\nMinus, but it's so disconnected from everything and out of nowhere that you can ignore it\nlike the low-quality Toriyama fever dream it is. The animation quality alone decides the\nday, BoG's best art style is nasty compared to DBS: Broly's worst.\n4. Kunxion\nExtremely good. One of the best Dragonball movies imo.\n5. blade55555\nI enjoyed it. Fun watch and the fight scenes are fantastic. Without spoilers, I watched\nVegeta's and the last fight scene way too many times.\n6. KeySlimePies\nI think it's easily the best movie. I ranked most of the movies in order of their quality.\nFor example of how I rated them the way I did: while The Tree of Might is really well-\nreceived on this subreddit, I think it's actually only so-so because the first half of the\nmovie is completely unrelated to the plot (putting out the forest fire) and the final\nfight with Turles is actually not that good. This is my list in order of quality:  Good:\nBroly (2018), Battle of Gods, Wrath of the Dragon, Dead Zone, The World's Strongest, Broly\n-- The Legendary Super Saiyan, Fusion Reborn, Resurrection 'F'  So-so: The Return of\nCooler, Cooler's Revenge, The Tree of Might, Bojack Unbound, Broly -- Second Coming, Super\nAndroid 13!  Bad: Bio-Broly, Lord Slug\n7. ToodlesXIV\nIt's the best DB Movie by a mile, and honestly just peak Dragon Ball in general. The\nscript has Toriyama written all over it, and the animation is mind blowing.\n8. shlam16\nLore: 9/10  Story: 7/10  Animation: 10/10  Fights: 10/10  Music: 6/10 (others like the\nstyle, I didn't go for it)  Pacing: 3/10 (the main reason it needs to be adapted in the\nanime)  TL;DR - It's good, watch it. Then start reading the manga at Chapter 42 for the\nbest arc in Super to date.\n9. [deleted]\nPacing: 3/10  I agree with that. The movie felt like it could have been at least 2x longer\n(especially the first third) and they had to cut Toriyama's script down a lot apparently.\nThe director stated that Gogeta and Broly were originally going to fight on the Sun at one\npoint.  If they expanded the Saiyan/Bardock segment (with Bardock's last stand) and\ndedicate an episode to Gogeta vs Broly, then it would be amazing.\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\n10. EP1K\nIf they do adapt it I hope they don't drag it on as long as BoG. I honestly can't rewatch\nthose episodes of Super they're so drawn out. I'd love to see how Freeza held up so long\nagainst Broly. Maybe more Broly/Paragus backstory and more Planet Vegeta drama. The movie\ndid so many things right but the pacing was definitely a weak point.\n11. DetlefHemp\nI really enjoyed it. I actually showed it to my girlfriend to try and get her to get over\nthe whole \"anime is gay\" trap that a lot of people fall victim to... It was a success.\n12. SSJRemuko\nIts easily (imo) one of, if not the best DB related movie, ever.\n13. BlueFootedTpeack\ntop tier,  nice animation, very fast and expressive, plenty of detailed looks, cool music,\nfront loads the plot pretty heavily,  best db film\n14. kakkarot_73\nIt’s great. Oh and prepare yourself for the chants.\n15. lightedge\nOverall really good lore, really good animation too. There is some bad character CGI\nthough, such as the combined Goku and Vegeta beam attack that looks noticeably worse then\nthe real 2d art.\n16. Megadoomer2\nI'd say that it's one of my favourite DBZ movies - it's either DBS Broly or Battle of\nGods.\n17. ArtisanofWar7\nThe pacing is the only true issue, the music chants are personal preference  Otherwise,\nit's probably the best if not one of the best dragonball movies there is\n18. ItsLucs\nIt's a good film, good animation, good music... But it's empty, 30 min of story, 1h15 of\nfighting, and some scenes would have been more developped i think :) but it's still one of\nmy favorite :)\n19. Finally_Vanilla\nYou know where Brolys dad said \"Attaaaaack!\" to broly? They did the same scene in this new\none and i laughed and exited. I couldnt take it anymore.\n20. mhead26\nLooked a little disney in the graphics sometimes but other than that it was great.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_c1f28f25"}
